# Territory Acknowledgement 

We acknowledge and respect the L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n (Songhees and X&#695;seps&#601;m / Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n and W&#817;S&#193;NE&#262; Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

In [this video](https://youtu.be/RJHMmMwTl_Q?si=9x4rNjmbCZ_O6HhW), Yux&#8217;wey&#8217;lupton, Dr. Clarence "Butch" Dick of the Songhees Nation, welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n (Songhees and X&#695;seps&#601;m / Esquimalt) and W&#817;S&#193;NE&#262; Peoples in L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n and English. The updated acknowledgement was developed through our continued dialogue and relationships with the local Nations, in recognition of their presence and governance structure in these territories. 

The video supports the UVic community to engage more meaningfully with the territorial acknowledgement. It is intended to inspire reflection, learning and accountability&#8212;while acknowledging that this is one step in a much broader journey of &#660;etaln&#601;w&#787;&#601;l&#787; | &#193;TOL,NEUEL | Respecting the rights of one another and being in right relationship with all things. It is one part of our shared, ongoing commitment to understanding the responsibilities we hold as guests in these territories and to act in ways that uphold our relationships with the original stewards of these lands.
